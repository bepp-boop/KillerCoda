We were able to deploy one container with Pulumi and Docker. Now let try to deploy multiple containers using Pulumi. We will create a simple Pulumi program that runs two containers: one running an nginx server and the other running a Redis server. The nginx server will be accessible on port 8000, and the Redis server will be accessible on port 6379.

First, let's edit Python file and write the following code:

```python
import pulumi
import pulumi_docker as docker

# Existing code here

# Define the Redis Docker image
redis_image = docker.RemoteImage("redis_image", name="redis:latest")

# Create a Redis Docker container
redis_container = docker.Container("redis_container",
    image=redis_image.name,
    ports=[
        docker.ContainerPortArgs(
            internal=6379,  # Redis default port
            external=6379,
        )
    ],
)

# Export the IDs of the containers
pulumi.export("nginx_container_id", nginx_container.id)
pulumi.export("redis_container_id", redis_container.id)
``` 

Let deploy the program once again

`pulumi up`{{exec}}

The program will delete the existing containers and create two new containers: one running an nginx server and the other running a Redis server. It will also output the container name and port. You can access the nginx server by visiting. This would also update the stack with any new resources that needed for the deployment.

Verify that the containers are running by running the following commands:

```
docker images
docker ps
sleep 2
```
